           To my Dearest, Fiona, Happy 9th to us my love! 9 months in and I still love you the way I did since the 
           day we made it official. My love for you grows bigger as we go along with
           our relationship. We have had some hard times with ourselves, and I'm glad
           that I have you by my side even though we were at our lowest. Your patience 
           and understand is something that I will always admire about you, I know that
           it isn't easy for you. Falling in love with you was the easiest thing I've ever done,
           I got that from the Green Book movie by the way, amazing movie. Your love gives me the
           strength that I need to get through the day. I can't help myself but smile everytime
           you pop up in my thoughts, you truly make me happy, even in the bluest of my days. Just so
           you know that I am not going anywhere, I am always here for you, by your side, ready to 
           have this journey of life with you. I wouldn't have wished anyone else but to have you in my life.
           You have my heart at the palm of your hands. Thank you for the patience, the understanding, the care
           and the love that you have given me, I will always be grateful for it. 

           I see a person who is worth of love and risk. You being happy already makes me happy, me seeing
           you smile makes my heart melt. Your love is something that's inexplainable by words alone, you truly 
           make everyone around you happy. You are enough, you are worth, I hope this world becomes kinder to you
           because you deserve it all, the love, the patience, the understanding, also the makeup and clothes and the cats
           the world has to offer. 
           
           I love you so much baby, I am forever grateful for loving me even though I'm bipolar and weird sometimes.
           I love you always, all ways. Happy 9th to us again, my love! Yours truly, Ching

        content: `To my Fiona, Happy 10th monthsary to us!!!🥳🥳🥳 It truly has been an amazing 10 months with you
        and damn, only 2 months left until our 1st Anniversary. The journey of life that we are having right now is something that
        I look forward to everyday. Even if it's happy, sad, or full of sulking, I'm so happy that I am spending my life with you.
        No matter what happens, nothing will break our bond for each other. It feels like that we were meant to cross paths and spend
        our life together. I love you so much that I overthink and worry about so many things. Since I am making this letter the day after
        our monthsary, I love and care for you so much that I literally had to walk around the whole of Enchanted Kingdom because you took 
        too long for that singular ride, I even chatted in our gspace. Though it's okay, at least you had fun with dana, and I am happy because
        of that too. The way that the world just got so much lighter seeing you is crazy. If the thing that calms you down is katinko, then you 
        are my katinko HAHAHAHAHAHA, I am so grateful to have you in my life. Thank you, really, thank you for loving and caring for me, I
        appreciate every single thing you do for me and hopefully I will be able to pay it back in the future. I want to relieve December 11, because
        it was truly a day that I could never forget. Thank you for making that day super memorable that I still vividly remember what happened during that
        day.
        
        I love you so much, don't you always forget that. If you feel like you are alone and that no one is at your side, think of me please.
        I love you so much, my love. All ways and always. I hope to get old with you!!!`

        I am so grateful to you, to have you, and about to enter a new chapter in life with you. It feels so surreal and natural at 
        the same time, crazy how time just like zoomed past us. You became my favority person, my safe place, my comfort, and my
        happiness. Every day that I spent with you has taught me what love truly feels like, patience, laughter, understanding,
        and choosing each other even on the hardest of days. Thank you for being you, your warmth, your gentleness, your smile, your eyes
        that instantly makes me lose it and go crazy, which makes me so happy and grateful to have you. We have grown so much as a couple in these
        past few months, and I couldn't be more grateful to experience life with you. You have made me feel worth it, made me feel that waking up the
        next day is worth it, and I wouldn't trade that with anything else in the world. As I write this letter for you, I am missing you so much. Hopefully,
        you know that I still carry your heart inside of my hands everyday, reminding myself that I am not alone, that I am loved, and that I am cared for. 
        Thank you for embracing the kind of person I am because I know that I may be too much sometimes, you are my katinko HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH new callsign ko nga
        sayo yun. Anyways, going back to the letter, I really love and miss you so much right now, I will literally cry if I don't get to see you on monday. I 
        can't wait to see you, because seeing you makes me feel so much lighter and it instantly makes me happy. Totoo pala yung sinasabi nila na you will meet someone
        na nakakabaliw and that is you. Nakakabaliw na hindi kita nakikita araw araw HAAHAAHAHHAHAHHAHA. Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read this letter, my love.
        I am so grateful, I would carry my heart out of my body to just show you how grateful I am to have you. You sheltered me from harm and kept me warm (please understand 
        this reference HAHAHAHAHAHA or search it on google). I love you so much, my baby. All ways and always.😘😘😘`

        title: "Happy Anniversary!",
        date: "February 11, 2026",
        content: `To my Dearest, Fiona, Oh. My. God. I cannot believe that I am writing this letter right now without feeling that feel of "Did I just actually make it" type of feeling. 
        Even as I write this letter for you, I feel like no word, no sentence, no letter, no essay, could ever fully describe how much you mean to me, but hopefully this letter will, because
        you truly deserve to hear it in every way possible. From that one moment of us talking all the way back in October 17, 2024, something shifted inside me. The world wasn't perfect and it 
        didn't get perfect in a very sudden way, but it became brighter, warmer, more alive. You slowly became my favorite thought, my safest home, and my happiest happiness. Loving you is like breathing,
        something that I need everyday, something natural, something that I don't have to force. I love you in ways that goes beyond grand gestures. I love you even in the smallest of moments, in the way 
        you talk about things you are passionate about, in your laugh that always makes me laugh too, in the softness of your voice, and even in the worry, because that just shows how you truly feel about me.
        It shows every part of you, even your flaws, I truly believe that they are precious to me. Before you, love was just an idea to me, something that I understood in theory. But when you came into my life, 
        you have showed and taught me how it actually feels like. You showed me how love is patient, understanding, effort, and choosing someone after days and days come by, even if things are hard. Loving you isn't
        something I do out of something just because, it's something I do with intention, with tenderness, and with my whole heart. Moments when I took a glance of you and feel overwhelmed, not because of fear,
        but because of gratitude. Gratitude in a world that is so chaotic and full of uncertainties, I found someone whose love feels like home to me. Someone who understand me when I struggle to express my feelings, 
        who sees through my flaws, and who still chooses to stay. You make me feel so safe in ways that cannot be described. I just love the way you exist in the world. I literally cannot stop talking about how much 
        you care to those people around you. Even if you are so tired, you still choose to help in any way possible. The way you worry because it shows how much love you actually carry inside. The way your smile can 
        make any bad day into an amazing day in almost an instant. The way your presence alone can bring my mind into peace. Loving you feels like I'm entering my sanctuary, something rare that I never would to take
        for granted. Thank you for loving me even in my questionable moments, my imperfect moments. Thank you for believing in me when I doubt myself. Thank you for being patient when I'm learning, your softness when I'm tired
        and your strength when I need it the most. You don't just love me, you nurture me, that is something that I will never stop appreciating. I want to be the person who protects your heart the way it deserves it to be protected.
        The person who listens to you everytime you yap, who comforts you when you had a bad day, and the person who stands by you when life feels heavy. I want to be someone you feel safe loving, someone who makes you feel seen,
        valued, and cherished. When I think about the future, it's always you that I think of. Not just in the biggest of my dreams, but also in the small quiet ones. Normal days become extraordinary simply because you're with me.
        You are my comfort, you are my courage, my sea, and my sun. The calm and my chaos. My favorite place to go to. Loving you has been the most beautiful experience I have ever felt, and I will never stop being
        grateful that I get to love you, and be loved in return. So today in our anniversary, I don't just celebrate our love, but I also honor it. I promise to continue on choosing you, learning you, and loving you more
        deeply as days pass on. I promise to grow with you, to walk beside you, and to hold your heart in the palm of my hands with care, loyalty, and devotion. Happy anniversary, my love. You are my heart's favorite story,
        the one that I will continue on writing about in my life. I love you endlessly, irrevocably ( a new word I learned ), and with everything that I am. I love you all ways, always. Forever yours, Pao`
